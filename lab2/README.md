### Lab 2:
An executable makefile is provided. `./lab1 -n <number of threads>` on a Unix/Mac terminal/shell should run the code. I used function pointers to allow for the passing of different hash functions. The default hash function is bcrypt which is incredibly computationally expensive so I don't reccommend using too many sessions/requests. "Ignoring header" print has been removed (commented out). "Failed to find request method/type line" will appear once for each session and is not an error. testload.txt has been configured for 4 sessions and 25 requests. lab2.cpp starts the server on port 8888. Therefore, `httperf --server <hostname/IP> --port <port> --wsesslog=sessions,1,somefile.txt` should accordingly be run on port 8888 as follows `httperf --server localhost --port 8888 --wsesslog=4,1,testload.txt`
